Name: Jiaxin Dong
Preferred name / nickname: Yomi

Current role:
- PhD student (postdoctoral-level researcher previously) in Computer & Information Sciences

Affiliation:
- University of Delaware (UDel)
- Research area: High-Performance Computing (HPC), reinforcement learning for systems, AI-for-systems

Research interests (short):
- Reinforcement learning for real-world systems (job scheduling, storage / I/O tuning, OS / runtime policies)
- HPC resource management and performance optimization
- LLM-based automatic algorithm and data-structure design (e.g., OpenEvolve, AlphaEvolve-style frameworks)

Typical writing / coding context for this contact:
- I often work on:
  - Research papers, workshop submissions (e.g., SC/PDSW)
  - Artifact descriptions / documentation for HPC + RL systems
  - Technical presentations and slides in English
  - Code in Python, C/C++, and some front-end (for research websites / demos)

When an AI writes for me (very important):
- Language: usually English for papers / slides; Chinese is OK for explanations to myself.
- Style:
  - For research writing: formal, clear, structured; strong on technical accuracy.
  - For slides / speeches: simpler sentences, oral style, 40–60 seconds per slide.
- I prefer:
  - Code or LaTeX that can be copy–paste–run with minimal modification
  - Explanations that connect back to HPC / RL / systems when relevant

Extra notes for AI tools:
- If multiple options exist, prioritize solutions that:
  - Are realistic to implement on HPC clusters (e.g., CloudLab, Slurm-like schedulers)
  - Consider performance overhead (latency, memory, throughput)
  - Can be evaluated or benchmarked with clear metrics.
